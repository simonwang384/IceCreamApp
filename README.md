# IceCreamApp

An app created in Android Studio using Java. This application calculates the price of a sundae you customize using the application. There are set prices in the code for each topping and size. I created this app in my Mobile Computing course and I learned many things about Android Studio. Such as Intents to move through different Activities and sending data through Intents, and also how to create basic UI widgets.
